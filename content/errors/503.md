**503 (Backend fetch failed) errors** indicate that our servers couldn't be reached. Most of the time, this error is transitory and a simple refresh will solve the issue. Sometimes though, the error may persist for a few minutes, usually caused by high server load which temporarily brings the server down.

When this happens, our servers usually recover within a few minutes. Most of the time though, refreshing the page in that instant will fix the issue.

# What can I do?
Try refreshing the page, that typically fixes the issue. If that doesn't help, try again in a few minutes.

If the issue persists for more than a few minutes though, please <a href="https://help.static.wikitide.net/contact">contact us</a>.
