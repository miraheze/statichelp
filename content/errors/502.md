**502 (Bad Gateway) errors** indicate that our servers responded incorrectly to a request. Most of the time, this error is transitory and a simple refresh will solve the issue.

# What happened?
These errors indicate either an invalid response or a lack of response from a server component such as PHP.

When this happens, it is typically because of high server load, commonly due to a DDoS attack.

When this happens, our servers usually recover within a few minutes. Most of the times though, refreshing the page in that instant will fix the issue.

# What can I do?
Try refreshing the page, that typically fixes the issue. If that doesn't help, try again in a few minutes.

If the issue persists for more than a few minutes though, please <a href="https://help.static.wikitide.net/contact">contact us</a>.
