`{{ {{draft}} }}`

If you are operating a bot, you must follow the rules below when setting a user agent. Failure to do so will likely result in you being rate-limited or blocked. This may affect your entire network without warning. Site Reliability Engineering deploys many methods to target abuse and utilise automated and manual actions.

Please note that additional restrictions may also apply. You should not make requests at an excessive rate.

## Rules 

* Your user agent must not mimic a browser UA
* You must include contact details (either a User name (clearly marked) or email)
