Goal Periods at Miraheze are biannual periods of time when certain tasks (called Goals) are given extra focus and resources to be resolved.

Goals are split into two categories:
* MediaWiki
* Site Reliability Engineering

Tasks must meet one of the following criteria to be considered as a goal:
* A long-term project that can realistically be finished before the end of goal period,
* A development project that will have a positive impact on Miraheze communities,
* An objective for Site Reliability Engineering (infrastructure, introducing a new service, major work etc.).

MediaWiki tasks being considered for a goal must have:
* Someone willing and committed to work on the task; or
* Have such a massive positive impact or overwhelming support by the wider community, that the completion of the task in said goal period will bring improvements to that service.

Site Reliability Engineering tasks being considered for a goal are left at the discretion of [the SRE team](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Tech:Organisation#Team:_Infrastructure,_Site_Reliability_Engineering).
