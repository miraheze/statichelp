Miraheze continually strives to provide a strong, community centred service; along with that comes community scrutiny and community involvement over projects that are planned to take up considerable resources in terms of development, reviewing efforts, deployment, or long-standing maintenance.

Below is a list of large projects that SRE has in mind, the idea of this page is to:
* Have a centralised place for active community discussion over merits, design specs, etc.
* Store all information about a project in a central place, not in [Phorge](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Phorge).
* Be planned and thoroughly thought through before being formally proposed as a project eligible for a goal.

A proposal template is available [here](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki//Template) and should be put in a subpage.

Anyone may:
* Propose a new project (see [here](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki//Template)).
* Comment on a proposal (use the talk page of the relevant proposal).
* Work on a proposal (see [Contributing](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Contributing) and *starting points* in a proposal for guidance).

## Current proposals 

* [Automation of SSL requests](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki//Automation_of_SSL_requests) — Implement a system where on request, users are able to generate a Lets Encrypt certificate which is then deployed to GitHub and to MediaWiki via $wgServer (after being approved by an SRE member) (~175 hours).
* [CreateWiki AI improvement](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki//CreateWiki_AI_improvement) — Improve the current AI system for CreateWiki to allow for different factors to be taken into account when assessing how 'good' a request is (~175 hours).
* [Proper CI for Miraheze extensions](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki//Proper_CI_for_Miraheze_extensions) — Implement proper continuous integration for extensions maintained by Miraheze (~175 hours).

## In progress 

* None yet.

## Completed 

* [List of Miraheze wikis](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki//Miraheze_Wiki_List) — A page where all wikis are listed off and can be ranked/categorised and viewed by all users.
* [Statistics page for all wikis](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki//Wiki_Statistics_Special_Page) — A page where analytical information for all wikis can be displayed using information collected and stored by Miraheze currently in Matomo.
* [Multiversion](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki//Multiversion) — Ability to deploy multiple MediaWiki versions to one server.
