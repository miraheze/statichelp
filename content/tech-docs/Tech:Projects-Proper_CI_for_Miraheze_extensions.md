title: Tech:Projects/Proper CI for Miraheze extensions
---

This is a project proposal to implement proper continuous integration for extensions developed and maintained by Miraheze.

## Background 

Currently, our extensions don't really have much continuous integration.

## Plan 

* Implement phpunit tests.

## Requirements 

There are no external requirements and no blockers requiring additional help.

## Outcome Steps 

* At least 51% CI coverage for CreateWiki and ManageWiki.

## Getting Started 

Anyone interested in starting this project should:
* Get in touch with an [SRE](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Tech:Organisation#Team:_MediaWiki,_Site_Reliability_Engineering) member to discuss how to proceed.
