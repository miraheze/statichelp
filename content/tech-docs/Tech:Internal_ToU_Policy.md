`{{ {{Tech policy}} }}`

The Technology team is authorized to enforce the Terms of Use and enact sanctions, up to and including [global bans](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/global_bans), as emergency measures to protect the operational stability of Miraheze. No more action should be taken than is necessary to stabilize Miraheze. These actions are subject to review by [Trust and Safety](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Trust_and_Safety).

## Examples 

**Example 1:** A user is using a bot/automated script to automatically generate a large number of pages per second, which is degrading the service, the Technology team would:
* Temporarily block the user and then alert T&S of the behavior and the action taken by the Technology team.

**Example 2:** A user attempts to DDOS or otherwise gain access to Miraheze servers, the Technology team would:
* Globally lock the user and potentially globally block or rangeblock IPs used by the user, and then alert T&S of the behavior and the action taken by the Technology team.

**Example 3:** A wiki contains several pages which describe how to DDOS or otherwise hack Miraheze servers, the Technology team would:
* Delete the wiki (as closing and making it private would still allow its users to access it and harm Miraheze);
* Block or lock any users involved in writing the how-to guides (as they could replicate that information on other wikis); and
* Alert T&S of the behavior and the action taken by the Technology team.
