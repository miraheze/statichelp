### What is the Technology team?
Who do you think runs the show behind the scenes in the server room? The Technology team (whose members may also be known as **system administrators**, and were formerly known as Site Reliability Engineers) does! We're a group of people who all work together to ensure Miraheze runs smoothly and that our users are satisfied. Just like everyone else, we're unpaid volunteers who love our users and always put them first!
