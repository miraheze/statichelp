title: Tech:Projects/Template
---

This is a template for project proposals for Miraheze goals. The structure below should be copied to a subpage of [Tech:Projects](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Tech:Projects) and completed to provide helpful and informative content on the project, as well as acting as a basic design specification.

## Background 

This section should:
* Outline any problems currently experienced in Miraheze that this project sets out to solve;
* Cover if there is anything in Miraheze that relates to the project—software, services, etc.;
* Act as a way to convey to readers any contextual information behind the project—why is this project being proposed at all?

## Plan 

The plan section is the meat and bones of any project proposal. This section should be as organised as possible and include several key points:
* What will the project include?
* How will the final product look?
* How will the final product work?
* How will the project be integrated with the current services deployed?
* What changes (if any) need to be made to the Miraheze infrastructure or existing services?
* How will the project be deployed when it is finished or in parts when they're complete?

Examples, mock-ups, etc., are extremely helpful to put across what the final product should look and behave like.

## Requirements 

This section should:
* Identify any technical limitations in Miraheze or upstream software that needs to be resolved;
* Any external (or internal from separate people) support or assistance that is needed to ensure success;

## Outcome Steps 

This section should list of any outcomes/achievements that need to be met before the project can be considered completed.

## Getting Started 

This section is where you provide some basic pointers or places to start for people who may be interested in starting on the project. These can include anything from talking to someone, reading some relevant upstream documentation, or even a link to an existing Phorge ticket that starts the project off.
