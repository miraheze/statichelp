title: Tech:Responsible disclosure
---

Miraheze takes the security of its data and servers very seriously. Where possible and feasible, we put technical and social measures in place to protect our services. However, being online inherently comes with security risks. If you find a security issue on our platform, you are encouraged to work with us to resolve the issue! This page lists our [responsible disclosure policy](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/:w:Responsible_disclosure).

## Report a security issue 

Regardless of the severity of the issue, we urge you to **not discuss the issue publicly**. Miraheze expects you to play by these rules:
* If you have a Miraheze or GitHub account, you can use our [special Phorge form](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/phorge:maniphest/task/edit/form/2) for reporting your findings, which creates a task hidden from public view and notifies our Security team. If you choose to use Phorge, do not create a task using other forms! You can also send your findings via e-mail to security `{{ {{@}} }}`miraheze.org,
* Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered, for example by downloading more data than necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability or deleting or modifying other people's data,
* Do not reveal the problem to others until it has been resolved,
* Do not use attacks on physical security, social engineering, distributed denial of service, spam, or applications of third parties, and
* Do provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem, so we will be able to resolve it as quickly as possible. Usually, the IP address or the URL of the affected system and a description of the vulnerability will be sufficient, but complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation.

Miraheze would like to thank you for following this policy. As such, Miraheze promises the following:
* If you have followed the instructions above, we will not take any legal action against you regarding the report.
* We will handle your report with strict confidentiality, and not pass on your personal details to third parties without your permission.
* We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the issue.
* In the public information concerning the problem reported, we will give your name as the discoverer of the problem (unless you desire otherwise).
