Experimental wikis are active wikis with experienced contributors that have agreed to receive changes earlier than others and provide feedback to SRE. Please ping SRE, so they can consider running a cache purge if they desire when enabling the flag.

To have the flag enabled in ManageWiki (by a Steward), the following criteria must be met:
* The wiki must be active and used regularly.
* The wiki must be public.
* Users on the wiki should be technically competent and polite.
* The wiki should have a variety of extensions installed (especially Cargo/Social Profile/FlaggedRev/DPL/Complex ones).
* The wiki should use gadgets or user scripts.
 `{{ {{note}} }}` The feature should be enabled on no more than 50 wikis.

The following features are enabled on experimental wikis:
* [Parser Media Structure changes](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsing/Media_structure)
* [JQuery Migrate](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate) (now disabled)
